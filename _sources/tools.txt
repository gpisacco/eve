Auto generate API documentation with Eve-docs
---------------------------------------------
*by Charles Flynn*

Eve provides powerful capabilities for quickly building RESTful APIs. The
`Eve-docs`_ blueprint extends these capabilities with API documentation. You
activate the blueprint in your launch script, and Eve-docs creates the
documentation from your existing Eve configuration file, with no additional
configuration required.

Eve-docs generates documentation in HTML using `Twitter Bootstrap`_. You can
expand each domain to show available endpoints and methods, and further expand
each method to show parameter details. Eve-docs also publishes the
documentation data as JSON for programmatic consumption.

For more detail see the `project repo`_ on Github.
